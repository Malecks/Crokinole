Crokinole (/ËˆkroÊŠkÉªnoÊŠl/ KROH-ki-nohl) is a dexterity board game similar in various ways to pitchnut, carrom, marbles, shove ha'penny, with elements of shuffleboard and curling reduced to table-top size. Players take turns shooting discs across the circular playing surface, trying to have their discs land in the higher-scoring regions of the board, while also attempting to knock away opposing discs.
